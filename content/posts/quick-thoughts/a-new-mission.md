OK, so maybe _no man_ is overselling it rather a lot.  In fact, a lot of people have gone there before! but i'm entering a strange new world for me.  For quite a while now, i've written blogs for other people, but now - i'm entering a world where i'm writing content just because I can for me!

## How Much Can We Expect?

I'm aiming to produce 3 articles a week - so 156 a year.  I might do more, but that's the minimum.  Yes, it's a lot of writing - and yes, it's going to be a lot of content to wade through, but honestly - it's going to give me an outlet to share a lot of my thinking in a way that works well for me.

## What Can We Expect Content On?

I'm going to be writing content on multiple topics:

* PHP
* Javascript
* Python
* GoLang
* SQL
* Software Design Patterns
* Software Optimisation Patterns
* APIs
* Packages I Write
* Packages I Use
* Software I Use

I might even plan more! initially, I'm going to write three for each of these just so we've got some content up and going.

## How Long Can We Expect Articles To Be?

You can expect a minimum of 1,500 words per article - but there might be a few "quick thoughts" - if it's less than 1,500 words, it'll be in the quick thoughts category, not the others so you can find them quickly.

## There Seems To Be A Lot Of Categories There?

Absolutely! And that's because I use a lot of these on a day to day basis.  So I can venture into some fun things I do daily.

So there we go - the first "quick thoughts" post done! it introduces my plan, and lets you know whats coming.  Oh, and to put this into context for size - this article is a mere 305 words.
